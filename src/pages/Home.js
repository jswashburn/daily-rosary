                <p>
                    This site was something I made to help refresh some front end skills that I have lost over the years. I am Catholic, and I love praying the rosary, but I have not found any nice interactive rosary-praying websites online, so I decided to build myself a custom one!

                <p>
                    This site is a simple static web app, hosted on Azure. It is built with React.js! I have done my best to keep things simple. See the github repo here for details!

                <p>
                    For anyone who doesn't know what a rosary is, it is a Catholic tradition where we take rosary beads and recite certain prayers out loud, while meditating on certain events in the life of Jesus Christ. It is one of my favorite parts of the day! Every day of the week, a different set of meditations is used. These are called "mysteries" and they are those key moments in which we reflect during our prayer. To help myself and others remember which mysteries are for the current day, I have set this site up to automatically load the days mysteries.
