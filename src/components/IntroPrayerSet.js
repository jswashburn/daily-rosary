          I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth,
          and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the
          Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate,
          was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the
          third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is
          seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he
          will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy
          Spirit the holy catholic Church the communion of saints the
          forgiveness of sins the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.
          Amen.

          thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
          daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
          trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
          from evil. Amen.
