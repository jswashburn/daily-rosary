              <h2>The Annunciation of Our Lord</h2>
              <p>
                The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called
                Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the
                house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. And coming to
                her, he said, "Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you." But she
                was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of
                greeting this might be. Then the angel said to her, "Do not be
                afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. Behold, you
                will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name
                him Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most
                High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his
                father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of
                his kingdom there will be no end." Mary said, "Behold, I am the
                handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your
                word." Then the angel departed from her. (Luke 1:26-33, 38) As
                an angel proclaimed the conception of Christ in Mary's virginal
                womb, so do mothers and fathers learn every day of the
                conception of their child. Let us pray to the Mother of all the
                Living that every child be treasured and protected from the
                first moment of conception as an inestimable and wondrous gift
                of God.

              <h2>The Visitation</h2>
              <p>
                During those days Mary set out and traveled to the hill country
                in haste to a town of Judah, where she entered the house of
                Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's
                greeting, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth, filled
                with the holy Spirit, cried out in a loud voice and said, "Most
                blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your
                womb. And how does this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord
                should come to me? For at the moment the sound of your greeting
                reached my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed
                are you who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord
                would be fulfilled." (Luke 1:39-45) As the child in Elizabeth's
                womb leaped for joy when the Blessed Virgin, pregnant with the
                Son of God, came to meet her, so may our hearts leap with joy at
                the wonders of new life promised in every expectant mother.

              <h2>The Nativity of Jesus</h2>
              <p>
                While they were there, the time came for her to have her child,
                and she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in
                swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no
                room for them in the inn. Now there were shepherds in that
                region living in the fields and keeping the night watch over
                their flock. The angel of the Lord appeared to them and the
                glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were struck with
                great fear. The angel said to them, "Do not be afraid; for
                behold, I proclaim to you good news of great joy that will be
                for all the people. For today in the city of David a savior has
                been born for you who is Messiah and Lord. And this will be a
                sign for you: you will find an infant wrapped in swaddling
                clothes and lying in a manger." (Luke 2: 6-12) In the birth of
                every child we see the birth of Christ Jesus in the Bethlehem
                stable. Let us commend all new mothers and fathers and every
                newborn child to the protection and intercession of the Mother
                of God and Mother of all Christians.

              <h2>The Presentation in the Temple</h2>
              <p>
                Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man
                was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel,
                and the holy Spirit was upon him. It had been revealed to him by
                the holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen
                the Messiah of the Lord. He came in the Spirit into the temple;
                and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform the
                custom of the law in regard to him, he took him into his arms
                and blessed God, saying: "Now, Master, you may let your servant
                go in peace, according to your word, for my eyes have seen your
                salvation, which you prepared in sight of all the peoples, a
                light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people
                Israel." (Luke 2:25-32) As Christ was consecrated to God at his
                presentation in the temple, so may we consecrate all children to
                that holiness, purity, and innocence by which they lead us to
                God. "A little child shall lead them."

              <h2>The Finding in the Temple</h2>
              <p>
                Each year his parents went to Jerusalem for the feast of
                Passover, and when he was twelve years old, they went up
                according to festival custom. After they had completed its days,
                as they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in
                Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. Thinking that he was
                in the caravan, they journeyed for a day and looked for him
                among their relatives and acquaintances, but not finding him,
                they returned to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days
                they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the
                teachers, listening to them and asking them questions, and all
                who heard him were astounded at his understanding and his
                answers. When his parents saw him, they were astonished, and his
                mother said to him, "Son, why have you done this to us? Your
                father and I have been looking for you with great anxiety." And
                he said to them, "Why were you looking for me? Did you not know
                that I must be in my Father's house?" But they did not
                understand what he said to them. (Luke 2:41-50) As the Christ
                Child was found in the temple by the Blessed Virgin Mary and
                Saint Joseph, so we pray for all children, especially those lost
                and forgotten. May the Gospel of Life impel us to find them when
                they are most in need and to lead them home to a place where
                they are treasured, protected, and loved.
