      <h1>The Sorrowful Mysteries</h1>

      <ContentSection title="The Agony in the Garden">
        Jesus comes with his disciples to the garden of Gethsemane and prays to
        be delivered from his Passion, but most of all, to do the Father's will.
        Let us pray that Christ might hear the prayers of all who suffer from
        the culture of death, and that he might deliver them from the hands of
        their persecutors.
      </ContentSection>

      <ContentSection title="The Scourging at the Pillar">
        Falsely accused before Pilate, Jesus is cruelly tied to a pillar and
        scourged, then clothed in a cloak of purple and mocked. Let us pray for
        all innocent victims, that by the merits of his most holy Passion,
        Christ might deliver them and grant them eternal life.
      </ContentSection>

      <ContentSection title="The Crowning with Thorns">
        Pilate mocks the Christ by asking him if he is the King of the Jews. He
        is the King of all the world, through whom all things were made. He is
        the one who will judge the living and the dead at the end of time. Yet
        he is crowned with suffering out of love for us, in reparation for our
        sins.
      </ContentSection>

      <ContentSection title="The Carrying of the Cross">
        Three times Christ falls under the weight of the Cross as he carries our
        sins to Calvary. Let us pray for all who struggle to live the Gospel of
        Life, that they might pick up their crosses and walk the way of sorrows
        with the Savior of the world.
      </ContentSection>

      <ContentSection title="The Crucifixion">
        Innocent and without sin, Jesus opens his arms upon the cross out of
        love for us. Let us join our sufferings, and the sufferings of the whole
        world, to his one perfect sacrifice of praise.
