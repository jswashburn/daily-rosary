      <ContentSection snap title="Baptism in the Jordan">
        The Lord Jesus is Baptized in the Jordan River by John the Baptist, as a
        voice cries to us from the heavens: “This is my beloved Son, hear him!”
        Let us listen to Christ and, with his grace, work for the protection of
        every person from conception to natural death.

      <ContentSection snap title="The Wedding Feast at Cana">
        When they had run out of wine, Jesus blessed water and turned it into
        wine. May Jesus transform the darkness of sin and death in the
        proclamation of the Gospel of Life.

      <ContentSection snap title="Proclamation of the Kingdom of God">
        Jesus called the crowds to conversion, proclaiming that the Kingdom of

      <ContentSection snap title="Transfiguration">
        The Lord Jesus led Peter, James and John with him to the top of the
        mountain where he was transfigured in light, and his garments shown
        whiter than snow. May Christ’s glorious light shine on all who dwell in
        the shadow of darkness and sin.

      <ContentSection snap title="Institution of the Eucharist">
        On the night before he suffered, he took bread, blessed it, broke it,
        gave it to his disciples, and said, Take this, all of you, and eat it.
        This is my body.. When supper was ended he took a cup filled with wine,
        gave it to them, and said, Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for
        this is the cup of my blood. Strengthened by the Holy Eucharist, may we
        work to proclaim the Gospel of life and defend all who are endangered by
        the culture of death.
