                On the night before he suffered, he took bread, blessed it, broke it, gave it to his disciples, and said, Take this, all of you, and eat it. This is my body.. When supper was ended he took a cup filled with wine, gave it to them, and said, Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the cup of my blood. Strengthened by the Holy Eucharist, may we work to proclaim the Gospel of life and defend all who are endangered by the culture of death.
